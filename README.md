# 8086 computer

A single board 8086 based computer with a full keyboard and RGB LCD screen.
The project includes an assembler, and maybe in the future a c compiler.

It's a new version of my 8086 computer (the old one moved to repository "8086_OLD").
This one focuses mainly on PCB design.

Folders in this repository:
 - 8086 board - KiCad project folder. Schematics and PCB design.
 - assembler - Custom 8086 assembler.
 - coprocessor - Software for the coprocessor.
